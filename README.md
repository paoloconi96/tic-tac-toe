This projects aim to be a very simple implementation of the classical game Tic-tac-toe.

Also, this is a PET project to better learn Java, Gradle, Spring Boot and the environment in general. 
So consider this is the final objective for this project.

These are the features I would like to build next:
1. ~~Game menu~~
2. ~~Players name assignment~~
3. ~~Handle draw game~~
4. ~~Single player match~~
5. ~~Refactor computeWinner and computerMark~~
6. ~~Refactor using SpringBoot~~
7. Unit tests of all core components
8. Web API interface and functional tests
9. Handle multiple matches in parallel
10. Single player match: different levels 
11. Translations improvements 
12. Larger board (4x4, 5x5, etc)
13. Refactor using DDD/CQRS
