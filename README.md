This projects aim to be a very simple implementation of the classical game Tic-tac-toe.

Also, this is a PET project to better learn Java, Gradle, Spring Boot and the environment in general. 
So consider this is the final objective for this project.

These are the features I would like to build next:
- ~~Game menu~~
- ~~Players name assignment~~
- Improve computeWinner algorithm (also handling draw game)
- Single player match
- Improved validation
- Refactor using SpringBoot
- Refactor using DDD/CQRS
- Engine automated tests
- UI layer functional tests
- Single player match: different levels
- Translations improvements and support for other languages
- Larger board (4x4, 5x5, etc)
- Web API
